Project:                     MAPPING INDIA'S URBANISATION (Urban Growth of Indian Cities)

City Name:                   Bengaluru

Temporal resoultion:         Built-up: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014; Poulation: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2015 and VIIRS: 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015
 
Spatial resolution:          Built-up: 38 meter; Population: 250 meter and VIIRS: 463.05 meter

Dataset source:              1. GHSL - The Global Human Settlement (GHS) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. The spatial data here shows the distribution of built-up area and population for four time periods: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014. The built-up and population layer data has been extracted from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), see link for more information - http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/

                             2. VIIRS - Nightfire data make use of six spectral bands to detect and characterizes subpixel infrared emitters. Provides locations and times of hot pixel detections along with estimates of temperatures and source sizes. For cloud-free gas flares a calculation is performed to estimate the flared gas volume in methane equivalents. Day/night band - low light imaging data: Detections of lighting from cities, towns, villages, combustion sources and lit fishing boats.
